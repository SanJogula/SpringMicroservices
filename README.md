# Spring Microservices Project

This project is an exploration of microservices architecture using Spring Boot and Java. The project is built with Maven and uses Spring Cloud for managing the microservices.

## Concepts Explored

1. **Netflix Eureka Service Registry:** Utilized Netflix Eureka for service discovery, enabling automatic detection of network locations for service instances.

2. **Spring Cloud Config Server:** Employed the Spring Cloud Config Server for externalizing the configuration of the microservices, allowing for reconfiguration without the need for rebuild or redeployment.

3. **API Gateway:** Implemented an API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway, serving as the single entry point for all clients and handling request routing, composition, and protocol translation.

4. **Microservices Architecture:** Developed a project using the microservices architecture, which allows for the decomposition of the application into loosely coupled services.

This project is a representation of my exploration and understanding of building applications using the microservices architecture and Spring Boot.# SpringMicroservices
